Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
  
```

1.  **Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
    herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.**\
    The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 dear with 95% confidence would be around 60 deer (59 to be exact, according to the table)

2.  **Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
    following scenarios:**

    \
    **a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population**

    The sample size for detecting a disease at 1% prevalence with 95% confidence for a large population (say, a population of around 5000) would be around 290-300.\
    **b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population**

    The sample size for detecting a disease at 2% prevalence with 99% confidence for a large population (say, a population of around 5000) would be around 225-230.

    These sample sizes are pretty similar because although in the second scenario the confidence level went up, the % prevalence we want to detect at also went up. This means that although in theory one might think you need to sample more deer to be more confident, since in the second scenario you only need to detect at 2% instead of 1%, the sample sizes of the 2 scenarios are pretty similar.

3.  **You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
    300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you\
    are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =,\
    \>) \_\_\_\_%.**

    We are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in the facility is \< 1%

    Because of the rule of 3 for zero sample prevalence -\> 3/300 = .01

4.  **An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of\
    Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and\
    Russell counties).**

    [Lee County](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Lee.csv)

    [Chambers County](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Chambers.csv)

    [Russell County](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Russell.csv)\
    **a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county.\
    Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.**

    Lee County: Prevalence of lameness = 20% w/ 95% confidence between (14 - 52.5%)

    Chambers County: Prevalence of lameness = 26.7% w/ 95% confidence between (13.1 - 44.9%)

    Russell County: Prevalence of lameness = 3.1 % w/ 95% confidence between (0.9 - 8.7%)\
    **b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test**

    Between all 3 counties: p value = .0001 (less than .05 so the date is statistically significant and NOT due to chance)

5.  **Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.\
    She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:\
    Day 1: 3 fish infected\
    Day 2: 4 fish infected\
    Day 3: 7 fish infected\
    Day 4: 11 fish infected\
    Day 5: 20 fish infected\
    Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish\
    in the pond (including previously infected fish).**

    \
    **a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.**

    Day 1 incidence: 3/60 = .05 cases per fish-day

    Day 2 Incidence: 1/57 = .018 cases per fish-day

    Day 5 Incidence: 9/49 = .184 cases per fish-day\
    **b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?**

    Day 3 Prevalence: 7/60 = .1167

    Day 5 Prevalence: 20/60 = .333\
    **c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?**\
    On day 1 the prevalence and incidence are the same, both 3/60 = .05 (except prevalence has no units and incidents has units in fish-days)

### 10/01/2024 - Worksheet 4

Effective wildlife management is extremely important when it comes to maintaining biodiversity, protecting ecosystems, and controlling disease outbreaks. In order to control these things, it is essential that we have a deep understanding of wildlife/population systems. More specifically, it's important to understand complex disease systems and understand contributors to the disease and important parameters. This knowledge helps wildlife managers to effectively do their jobs and in turn protects humans as they attempt to prevent spillover of zoonotic diseases to humans. Modeling plays a vital role in understanding these dynamics. Essentially, modeling allows wildlife managers and other important stakeholders to think critically about a system and make good, educated decisions when it comes to management, disease prevention, and conservation. Starfield explains three essentials of good decision-making in his article, “A Pragmatic Approach to Modeling for Wildlife Management”. He explains that you first must know what the objectives are/what you are trying to achieve. Then you must be able to measure how a particular strategy will perform and be able to assess alternative options. These three pieces of knowledge can be obtained or drawn upon from modeling. For one, disease models allow you to forecast the dynamics of wildlife disease and see how management strategies impact the entire system. For example, Starfield explains a model that demonstrates changes in a buffalo population with and without culling. This is a great example of how models can be actively used to advise decisions. If, hypothetically the model projected that without any culling the buffalo population would grow out of control, that knowledge can allow wildlife managers to create a culling initiative. This idea can be similarly applied to a disease, a model could be drawn up forecasting the burden of disease with capturing and vaccinating a subset of a population, and without. This model could possibly show that capturing and vaccinating a subset of the population is not worth it when it comes to stopping the spread of a disease. This information is vital to public health officials and wildlife managers because we do not want to waste time, money, and resources on initiatives that won't have long-term benefits. One limitation of disease modeling is the predictive capacity. Disease models cannot predict the future without assumptions, and often times those assumptions are not the reality. For example, in some disease models, we assume that disease is randomly distributed, which in reality is not the case. For this reason, models can forecast future events but not predict without uncertainty. Additionally, often times we do not have complete data when it comes to wildlife diseases. It is unrealistic for us to test/observe every single animal in a population, so there often are data gaps. This is a challenge when it comes to creating a good model; however, that does not mean a model with incomplete data could not be helpful, it just means there is more uncertainty. Another limitation of modeling is ecological complexity. Wildlife populations exist in complex exosystems where there are many interactions, human influences, environmental factors, and confounding variables that are hard to predict. Just as we discussed in class a model cannot accurately account for human behavior changes when risk perception changes, a model cannot completely account for all behaviors of the ecosystem that we may not know about. However, despite these difficulties and limitations, models are still extremely helpful tools that force us to think critically about a system and advise decision-making and problem-solving. Combining models with other tools can be particularly helpful when it comes to management. For example, modeling can be coupled with surveillance programs. Regular monitoring of wildlife for the presence of disease provides real-time data that can then be actively put into a model to give the most up-to-date forecast of the disease. Other tools such as geographic information systems can give spatial analysis to measure disease prevalence and risk areas which then identify specific spatial areas that have a higher prevalence of disease than others. Lastly, modeling can be incorporated into stakeholder engagement to educate stakeholders and the community on wildlife disease or conservation efforts. Models can sometimes make it easier for the public to understand what is going on in complex wildlife systems. Overall, disease models serve as powerful tools in wildlife management, offering critical insights into disease dynamics and informing proactive and effective strategies. While we acknowledge the limitations of models, incorporating modeling with different tools and strategies enhances our ability to effectively manage disease and wildlife as a whole.
