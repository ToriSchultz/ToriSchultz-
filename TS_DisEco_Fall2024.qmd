Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
  
```

This image shows the epidemiology triad of environment, host and pathogen. This is a very simplified figure that demonstrates 3 of the major components of infection. Although this image is helpful to summarize ecology, in reality, ecology is much more complex than this image demonstrates.

### 09/12/2024 - Worksheet 2 & 3

![](images/ss_table.png)

1.  **Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
    herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.**\
    The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 dear with 95% confidence would be around 60 deer (59 to be exact, according to the table)

2.  **Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
    following scenarios:**

    \
    **a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population**

    The sample size for detecting a disease at 1% prevalence with 95% confidence for a large population (say, a population of around 5000) would be around 290-300.\
    **b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population**

    The sample size for detecting a disease at 2% prevalence with 99% confidence for a large population (say, a population of around 5000) would be around 225-230.

    These sample sizes are pretty similar because although in the second scenario the confidence level went up, the % prevalence we want to detect at also went up. This means that although in theory one might think you need to sample more deer to be more confident, since in the second scenario you only need to detect at 2% instead of 1%, the sample sizes of the 2 scenarios are pretty similar.

3.  **You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
    300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you\
    are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =,\
    \>) \_\_\_\_%.**

    We are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in the facility is \< 1%

    Because of the rule of 3 for zero sample prevalence -\> 3/300 = .01

4.  **An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of\
    Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and\
    Russell counties).**

    [Lee County](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Lee.csv)

    [Chambers County](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Chambers.csv)

    [Russell County](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Russell.csv)\
    **a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county.\
    Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.**

    Lee County: Prevalence of lameness = 20% w/ 95% confidence between (14 - 52.5%)

    Chambers County: Prevalence of lameness = 26.7% w/ 95% confidence between (13.1 - 44.9%)

    Russell County: Prevalence of lameness = 3.1 % w/ 95% confidence between (0.9 - 8.7%)\
    **b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test**

    Between all 3 counties: p value = .0001 (less than .05 so the date is statistically significant and NOT due to chance)

5.  **Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.\
    She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:\
    Day 1: 3 fish infected\
    Day 2: 4 fish infected\
    Day 3: 7 fish infected\
    Day 4: 11 fish infected\
    Day 5: 20 fish infected\
    Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish\
    in the pond (including previously infected fish).**

    \
    **a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.**

    Day 1 incidence: 3/60 = .05 cases per fish-day

    Day 2 Incidence: 1/57 = .018 cases per fish-day

    Day 5 Incidence: 9/49 = .184 cases per fish-day\
    **b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?**

    Day 3 Prevalence: 7/60 = .1167

    Day 5 Prevalence: 20/60 = .333\
    **c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?**\
    On day 1 the prevalence and incidence are the same, both 3/60 = .05 (except prevalence has no units and incidents has units in fish-days)
