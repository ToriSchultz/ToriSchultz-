This image shows the epidemiology triad of environment, host and pathogen. This is a very simplified figure that demonstrates 3 of the major components of infection. Although this image is helpful to summarize ecology, in reality, ecology is much more complex than this image demonstrates.

### 09/12/2024 - Worksheet 2 & 3

![](images/ss_table.png)

1.  **Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
    herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.**\
    The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 dear with 95% confidence would be around 60 deer (59 to be exact, according to the table)

2.  **Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
    following scenarios:**

    \
    **a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population**

    The sample size for detecting a disease at 1% prevalence with 95% confidence for a large population (say, a population of around 5000) would be around 290-300.\
    **b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population**

    The sample size for detecting a disease at 2% prevalence with 99% confidence for a large population (say, a population of around 5000) would be around 225-230.

    These sample sizes are pretty similar because although in the second scenario the confidence level went up, the % prevalence we want to detect at also went up. This means that although in theory one might think you need to sample more deer to be more confident, since in the second scenario you only need to detect at 2% instead of 1%, the sample sizes of the 2 scenarios are pretty similar.

3.  **You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
    300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you\
    are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =,\
    \>) \_\_\_\_%.**

    We are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in the facility is \< 1%

    Because of the rule of 3 for zero sample prevalence -\> 3/300 = .01

4.  **An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of\
    Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and\
    Russell counties).**

    [Lee County](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Lee.csv)

    [Chambers County](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Chambers.csv)

    [Russell County](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/DeerLameness_Russell.csv)\
    **a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county.\
    Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.**

    Lee County: Prevalence of lameness = 20% w/ 95% confidence between (14 - 52.5%)

    Chambers County: Prevalence of lameness = 26.7% w/ 95% confidence between (13.1 - 44.9%)

    Russell County: Prevalence of lameness = 3.1 % w/ 95% confidence between (0.9 - 8.7%)\
    **b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test**

    Between all 3 counties: p value = .0001 (less than .05 so the data is statistically significant and NOT due to chance)

5.  **Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.\
    She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:\
    Day 1: 3 fish infected\
    Day 2: 4 fish infected\
    Day 3: 7 fish infected\
    Day 4: 11 fish infected\
    Day 5: 20 fish infected\
    Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish\
    in the pond (including previously infected fish).**

    \
    **a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.**

    Day 1 incidence: 3/60 = .05 cases per fish-day

    Day 2 Incidence: 1/57 = .018 cases per fish-day

    Day 5 Incidence: 9/49 = .184 cases per fish-day\
    **b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?**

    Day 3 Prevalence: 7/60 = .1167

    Day 5 Prevalence: 20/60 = .333\
    **c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?**\
    On day 1 the prevalence and incidence are the same, both 3/60 = .05 (except prevalence has no units and incidents has units in fish-days)

### 10/01/2024 - Worksheet 4

Effective wildlife management is extremely important when it comes to maintaining biodiversity, protecting ecosystems, and controlling disease outbreaks. In order to control these things, it is essential that we have a deep understanding of wildlife/population systems. More specifically, it's important to understand complex disease systems and understand contributors to the disease and important parameters. This knowledge helps wildlife managers to effectively do their jobs and in turn protects humans as they attempt to prevent spillover of zoonotic diseases to humans. Modeling plays a vital role in understanding these dynamics. Essentially, modeling allows wildlife managers and other important stakeholders to think critically about a system and make good, educated decisions when it comes to management, disease prevention, and conservation. Starfield explains three essentials of good decision-making in his article, “A Pragmatic Approach to Modeling for Wildlife Management”. He explains that you first must know what the objectives are/what you are trying to achieve. Then you must be able to measure how a particular strategy will perform and be able to assess alternative options. These three pieces of knowledge can be obtained or drawn upon from modeling. For one, disease models allow you to forecast the dynamics of wildlife disease and see how management strategies impact the entire system. For example, Starfield explains a model that demonstrates changes in a buffalo population with and without culling. This is a great example of how models can be actively used to advise decisions. If, hypothetically the model projected that without any culling the buffalo population would grow out of control, that knowledge can allow wildlife managers to create a culling initiative. This idea can be similarly applied to a disease, a model could be drawn up forecasting the burden of disease with capturing and vaccinating a subset of a population, and without. This model could possibly show that capturing and vaccinating a subset of the population is not worth it when it comes to stopping the spread of a disease. This information is vital to public health officials and wildlife managers because we do not want to waste time, money, and resources on initiatives that won't have long-term benefits. One limitation of disease modeling is the predictive capacity. Disease models cannot predict the future without assumptions, and often times those assumptions are not the reality. For example, in some disease models, we assume that disease is randomly distributed, which in reality is not the case. For this reason, models can forecast future events but not predict without uncertainty. Additionally, often times we do not have complete data when it comes to wildlife diseases. It is unrealistic for us to test/observe every single animal in a population, so there often are data gaps. This is a challenge when it comes to creating a good model; however, that does not mean a model with incomplete data could not be helpful, it just means there is more uncertainty. Another limitation of modeling is ecological complexity. Wildlife populations exist in complex exosystems where there are many interactions, human influences, environmental factors, and confounding variables that are hard to predict. Just as we discussed in class a model cannot accurately account for human behavior changes when risk perception changes, a model cannot completely account for all behaviors of the ecosystem that we may not know about. However, despite these difficulties and limitations, models are still extremely helpful tools that force us to think critically about a system and advise decision-making and problem-solving. Combining models with other tools can be particularly helpful when it comes to management. For example, modeling can be coupled with surveillance programs. Regular monitoring of wildlife for the presence of disease provides real-time data that can then be actively put into a model to give the most up-to-date forecast of the disease. Other tools such as geographic information systems can give spatial analysis to measure disease prevalence and risk areas which then identify specific spatial areas that have a higher prevalence of disease than others. Lastly, modeling can be incorporated into stakeholder engagement to educate stakeholders and the community on wildlife disease or conservation efforts. Models can sometimes make it easier for the public to understand what is going on in complex wildlife systems. Overall, disease models serve as powerful tools in wildlife management, offering critical insights into disease dynamics and informing proactive and effective strategies. While we acknowledge the limitations of models, incorporating modeling with different tools and strategies enhances our ability to effectively manage disease and wildlife as a whole.

### 10/23/2024 - Response from in lab Fecal Egg Counts

Performing fecal egg counts and understanding how the information collected is used was so interesting. For one, I learned that there are many different ways to do fecal egg counts. In this procedure we mixed up the fecal sample with water, strained it, vortexed it, and combined it with a sugar solution. She explained that the sugar solution allows the eggs to float to the top and actually be visible. Additionally, the specific gravity of the sugar solution used depends on what type of eggs in particular you're looking for. In this lab, she is specifically looking for helmith eggs. The sample was then placed in an egg counting slide with a grid and we waited 5 minutes for the eggs to come to the top. Each egg found on the slide is 50 eggs per g of feces. It was super interesting to hear how this research can have an impact. She explained that they do fecal egg counts before and after the animals are given de wormer to see how effective the de wormer is. However she also explained that same de wormer cannot be given to the animals too much because there are concerns about resistance, something she is researching. It was also interesting that dairy cows do not have as many eggs generally because they are not in the pasture as much. What was also interesting to me was that for some sheep and goats they check their eyes and rank the level of redness on a scale of 1-10. If they are very white this indicates they're anemic and need de wormer because a parasite is sucking their blood. Overall, this lab was extremely interesting and allowed me to see first hand how we conduct research about disease ecology.

### 11/05/2024 - Worksheet #6

1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

Based on the community epidemiology framework from Fenton & Pedersen, I would classify the Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover. This is because the virus did have a spillover event to humans from close contact with a human and egyptian bat. However, there is low human to human transmission meaning the transmission rate is low in H2. As explained, the only transmission human to human has occurred through those in close proximity like health care workers. This places the marburg virus outbreak in the spillover category.

2\. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

In order to address this spillover event and minimize risk, a multifaceted approach is needed. Early detection and surveillance is particularly important. It would be important to contact trace and screen individuals like healthcare workers who come in contact with infected individuals to isolate potential cases early. On a community level it could be beneficial to raise awareness about the symptoms related to marburg virus so that the community is more knowledgeable which could aid in early detection. Additionally, ensuring that healthcare workers coming in close contact with patients infected with marburg virus are properly handling body fluids, etc is extremely important. Lastly, community efforts to educate the general population on avoiding animal contact, especially with bats, would be important to reducing risk of transmission.

### 11/21/2024 - Worksheets 7,8,9,10

I first compared the prevalence of raccoon Baylisascaris procyonis in **adult raccoons vs young adult raccoons** to get the following conclusions.

#### Adult: 36 infected, n=69

prevalence = .522/**52.2%** w/ 95% confidence between (.404-.638)

#### Young Adult: 14 infected, n= 37

prevalence = .378/ **37.8%** w/ 95% confidence between (.234-.541)

#### **Fischers comparison**: p = .2206 - not statistically significant

From this data, specifically the fischer's comparison, we can see that there is no statistical difference between the prevalence of adult raccoonas vs young adult raccoons which is very interesting. At first, I would have assumed there would be a higher prevalence in the younger raccoons from initially analyzing the disease system. The eggs are shed in feces of the raccoons and then become infective in the environment as they progress and become an egg with larva inside. I initially thought that young raccoons would have greater contact with these infected outdoor areas as they are likely exploring new areas and are more curious than their older counterparts. However, after seeing the data that there is a slightly higher prevalence in older raccoons, I concluded that this could have resulted from cumulative exposure of the adult raccoons. As they have been alive longer, they have had many more opportunities to be exposed to Baylisascaris procyonis than younger raccoons which means they could accumulate a higher burden of infection over time. However, as the p value is not lower than .05, there is not a statistically significant different between these two prevalences.

I then compared the prevalence of raccoon Baylisascaris procyonis in **male raccoons vs female raccoons** to get the following conclusions.

#### Male: 26 infected, n=69

prevalence = .377/37.7% w/ 95% confidence between (.267-.500)

#### Female: 24 infected, n= 37

prevalence = .649/64.9% w/ 95% confidence between (.486-.786)

#### Fischers comparison: p = .0087 statistically significant

This data was particularly interesting because it indicates a statistically significant difference between the prevalence in males (37.7%) and females (64.9%). Here we can see females on average had a higher prevalence of Baylisascaris procyonis than males. In analyzing the disease system, I think that behavioral differences of males vs female raccoons could be part of the explanation of this difference. The social and behavioral habits of the raccoon is directly related to its risk of ingesting Baylisascaris procyonis eggs. In other words, there are certain raccoon behaviors that place them at a higher risk for infection. For example, female raccoons are more likely to be caring for young offspring in areas like, dens, foraging areas, or other sites where infected animals are shedding eggs. While caring for their offspring and gathering food for their young, the female raccoons have many more opportunities to come into contact with contaminated feces than males do. Another idea I considered to explain this statistically significant difference is that during pregnancy, the female raccoon's immune system could be slightly compromised leading to a higher likelihood of infection. Theses complex ideas are very interesting to me and applicable to the concepts of disease ecology as disease is not as simple as it might seem. There are many many factors, including host behavior, that contribute to the disease system and these are sometimes unpredictable factors that are difficult to forecast. However, this knowledge of differing prevalences between males and females can help guide future interventions. For example, we can design targeted monitoring and surveillance systems that focus on females to help researchers and disease ecologists understand how behavior and sex can impact the spread of an infection like this.

Lastly, I looked at the differences in prevalence of Baylisascaris procyonis between the **north, central & south** locations to get the following conclusions.

#### North: 14 infected, n= 49 

prevalence = .286/28.6% w/ 95% confidence between (.170-.428)

#### Central: 9 infected, n= 14

prevalence = .643/ 64.3% w/ 95% confidence between (.371-.847)

#### South: 27 infected, n = 43

prevalence = .628/ 62.8% w/ 95% confidence between (.477-.759)

#### Fischer's Comparison between North & South: p = .0015 statistically significant

In analyzing this data, I chose to perform the fischer's comparison between raccoons in the north and south region because they had a similar n of 43/49 raccoons, however they had very different prevalence values. The p value from this test was .0015 indicating a statistically significant difference in the prevalences. For this region I consider that environmental conditions may play a role. While the Baylisascaris procyonis eggs can remain viable in the environment for a very long time, warmer or humid conditions could enhance their ability to infect hosts, which could partially explain the higher prevalence in the south region. Additionally, in warmer areas raccoons are generally more active which increases the spread of infective feces therefore increasing the risk of a suscpetible raccoon coming in contact with infected feces, therefore increasing prevalence. This brings in the epidemiological triangle of host, pathogen and environment. Changes in the environment can impact host behavior and therefore susceptibility to infections. Another consideration is the role that other wildlife species play in the disease system. For example, as the prevalence is higher in the south region, it could be that the south has a higher density of other species that can act as transport hosts. Oppossums for example can act as a transport/paratenic hosts for Baylisascaris procyonis. These oppossums could be eaten by raccoons and then transport the infection to them. Therefore, the density of paratenic hosts in an area could have a direct impact on the prevalence within a population.

Overall, it is important to consider how many factors that you might not consider at first could actually have a great impact on a disease system and its spread. Here, I have demonstrated how Baylisascaris procyonis and its prevalence can be impacted by the environment, host behavior, and other wildlife species. Without a doubt, interventions for all infections like this must be multifactoral and take into account the many different factors that influence infection and spread. As we look to the future, disease ecologists, wildlife managers, epidemiologists, and public health authorities must work together to create innovative approaches to address issues.
