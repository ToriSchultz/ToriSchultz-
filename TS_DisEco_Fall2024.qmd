Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
  
```

This image shows the epidemiology triad of environment, host and pathogen. This is a very simplified figure that demonstrates 3 of the major components of infection. Although this image is helpful to summarize ecology, in reality, ecology is much more complex than this image demonstrates.
